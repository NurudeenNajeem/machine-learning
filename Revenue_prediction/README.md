# Machine learning prediction using regression
In regression analysis, we find the relationship between a response (dependent) variable and independent variables.
We also predict the future value of the dependent variable using the established relationship. 
Regression is a problem where we try to predict a continuous dependent variable using a set of independent variables. 
In this project, I am able to predict revenue based on independent variables. 
The evaluate metrics that I used is R-square. There are three error metrics that are commonly used for evaluating and reporting the performance of a regression model;
they are: 
* Mean Squared Error (MSE).
* Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
* Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
