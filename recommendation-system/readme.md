## Movie Recommendation System
The Movie Recommendation System is a web application designed to provide personalized movie
 recommendations based on user preferences. Leveraging data from The Movie Database (TMDb),
 the app employs collaborative filtering techniques to suggest movies similar to those the 
user enjoys. Users can interact with the app by selecting a movie they like from a dropdown
 menu. Upon clicking the "Recommend" button, the app fetches and displays a list of recommended movies along with their posters. The user interface is enhanced with visually appealing features such as an animated scrolling title and a background image, providing an engaging experience for movie enthusiasts.
